# Using `targets` and `crew.controller` with SLURM

This operates mostly as a reminder / demo to myself as to how the hell to make all these things work together. To use the `targets` package with `crew`/`crew.controller` is an important way to automate and not have to re-run jobs on the Digital Alliance Canada cluster, which uses SLURM.
